<h1 style="font-family: Arial; color:red;">IMPORTANT</h1>

<p style="font-family: Arial">To all downloaderâ€™s of my firmware compilations<br/>

DVRFlash.exe for WIN32 is included with all my compilations for Windows XP and was the current version at the time the archive was released.<br/>

Agent Smith has been busy with his updates to DVRFlash and the version in the archive may not be the latest version, and although this version should work satisfactory with the archive I recommend that you download and use the latest version of DVRFlash which is available at <a href="https://dvrflash.rpc1.org">https://dvrflash.rpc1.org</a>.
