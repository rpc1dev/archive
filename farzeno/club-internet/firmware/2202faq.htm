<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>1.(Most
common problem) After the flash, i can't boot or/and the Bios
give me an IDE error.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After the flash the
drive became a master drive even if it was in slave position .
There is no jumper on the DVD drive, the master/slave position is
stored in the firmware. 1R17 is a master firmware. After the
flash you have 2 primary master drive (the HDD and the DVD) it's
why the notebook won't start or give you an error.<br>
Solution : You have to change manually the position of the HHD to
slave position. That should solve the problem.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>2. After the
flash i can't check the DMA option? DVD playing is choppy.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This problem occur
generally on notebook who have an ALI chipset (like the IBM
Thinkpad I-serie 1400/1500 and probably other).<br>
Solution : You have to download the latest ALI IDE drivers
version 3.50 or 3.55 at </font><a href="http://www.ali.com.tw"><font

trying to play DVD-video, nothing happen?</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Solution See second
question. In some case, it could be usefull to uninstall the DVD
software and reinstall it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>4. My drive
is now RPC-1 but i always have a limited number of region change
allowed / or i can't play other region DVD?</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Solution : Hell, even
if the drive is RPC-1 you have to hack your DVDsoftware. You
should know that!! Look on </font><a
