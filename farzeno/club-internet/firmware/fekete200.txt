Here is the patched 2.00 F series patch for 6xSCSI drives.
Warning!
The originally released 2.0 firmware for SCSI it seems to be fully RPC2. Its possible after update
the drive will be definitively RPC2 indiferent from RPC jumper position!!! 
Some words about new Pioneer strike-back!
This new 2.x firmwares has very good protection system against my patches. I work to resolve
of an update for users who have already 2.x version. Momentary it NOT POSSIBLE TO RE-FLASH
the same firmware version (the modifying of the version number is not enough!) My 2.x patches converts the drives to RPC1 but not allow re-flashing to older or same version. (The defense system is active). The new 2.x firmwares is TOTALLY STRIKE BACK FROM PIONEER against my patched firmwares!
Stay tuned for best resolution....
